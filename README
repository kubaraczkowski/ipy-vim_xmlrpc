ipy_vimserver_xmlrpc adds simple connectivity between IPython and VIM.

This project is a fork from the original ipy_vimserver, which is embedded in
newest IPython releases. You can find it in launchpad at 
lp:~pivanov/ipython/devel

However, an important difference is applied here, namely the use of xmlrpc
protocol for communication instead of low-level sockets.
The difference is portability. This finally works under Windows.

IMPORTANT
the pdb does not work for the moment in my system. being tested... 
(any help?) 

Tested under Windows 7 with vim_without_cream and python2.6 and linux (eeebuntu)


==========================
Usage

Put the ipy_xmlrpc.vim file in ~/.vim/plugin/ or ~/vimfiles/plugin (windows)

inside ipython do:

import ipy_vimserver_xmlrpc	# maybe put it in  convienient place
ipy_vimserver_xmlrpc.setup()	# start the server. takes two arguments
				# port (default: 0 =automatic)
				# logging (defualt: False) logging to console

edit somefile.py		# this starts gvim with connectivity


The useable shortcuts are for the moment as in the old ipy_vimserver implementation:
<F4> run these lines (visual selection)
<F5> run this file
<C-F6> start pdb
<F6> set breakpoint
<s-F6> clear breakpoint
<F7> run the file in pdb
<s-F7> clear all breakpoints
<F9> toggle run file on save 
<S-F9> toggle reselect after send
<C-F5> toggle run on save


Hope somebody finds it useful!
