ipy_vimserver_xmlrpc adds simple connectivity between IPython and VIM.

This project is a fork from the original ipy_vimserver, which is embedded in
newest IPython releases. However, an important difference is applied here, 
namely the use of xmlrpc protocol for communication instead of low-level 
sockets.
The difference is portability. This finally works under Windows.

Tested under Windows 7 with vim_without_cream and python2.6 and linux (eeebuntu)

Hope somebody finds it useful!
